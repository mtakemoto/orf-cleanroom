# tools

Analysis scripts, all original code (see RULES.md).

Each script should:
- take raw.pixls.us file paths as arguments and not download anything itself (`pixls_samples.py` is the one exception);
- print or write aggregate statistics only, with no images or pixel dumps;
- run on CPU, with GPU acceleration optional;
- state at the top which finding (an ID from `findings/`), lead issue (`#n`) or OPEN-QUESTIONS item it supports.

## Example tools

**`suffix_match_probe.py`** supports lead #31 with exact suffix-equality counts
against independent within-block permutations that preserve escape positions.
It prints aggregate JSON, with every declared lag and explicit sample failures.
The frozen discovery and validation cohorts are in `tools/cohorts/`; later files
use a separate `replication` cohort with the same design metadata. Local paths
are supplied separately and never appear in output. This bounded descriptive
measure cannot establish or exclude dictionary coding. Synthetic exhaustive
permutation tests run with `python -I tools/suffix_match_probe.py --self-test`.

    python -I tools/suffix_match_probe.py --cohort PUBLIC_COHORT.json --measured-by @yourhandle --sample ID path/to/file.ORF

**`pixls_samples.py`** lists, checks and downloads raw.pixls.us Olympus/OM samples using the site's licence listing. It downloads CC0 files only and verifies SHA-256. See the top-level README.

**`manifest_rows.py`** turns local CC0 files into ready-made `samples/manifest.csv` rows, combining the licence listing with `orf_signature.py`.

**`orf_signature.py`** prints one CSV row per file with its measured container and payload facts: SHA-256, magic, make, model, payload size, bits per sample, compression tag, payload offset and bytes, and bits per pixel. It reads the TIFF structure only and decodes nothing.

    python tools/orf_signature.py path/to/* > rows.csv

**`bit_runs.py`** gives a histogram of zero-bit runs in the payload (MSB-first), as aggregate numbers. It's a starting point for bitstream work (the F1 lead, #11).

    python tools/bit_runs.py path/to/file.ORF --mb 1

Example output on raw.pixls.us `8549_OM System - OM-5 Mark II - 16bit (4_3).ORF` (CC0), first 1 MB:

    q= 0  share=0.48036
    q= 1  share=0.27349
    q= 2  share=0.13019
    q= 3  share=0.06272

**`orf_tokens.py`** parses the token stream described in lead #11 (q zero bits, stop bit, 5-bit suffix; escape at q >= 17) and prints aggregate statistics per file: tokens against width x height, bit alignment at multiples of the width, q histogram and escapes, suffix bit balance, H/L shares, and mutual information at token lags 1-3 (H->L, L->H, L->L, H->H), the b2 context gain and vertical lag 2, each with a baseline that shows the estimator bias. Numbers are printed as measured, whether or not they match that lead. It parses a prefix by default (`--max-tokens`, `--rows`); `--all` parses the whole payload.

    python tools/orf_tokens.py path/to/file.ORF --rows 400
    python tools/orf_tokens.py path/to/file.ORF --all

**`findings_index.py`** lists the verified findings under `findings/` by variant, with finder, verifier, title and status (verified or superseded). `--check` validates the files (file name, `Author:` matches the handle, `Verified by:` is another person, `Lead:` is `#n`, `Variant:` matches the folder, referenced IDs exist) and exits 1 on errors; CI runs it on pull requests.

    python tools/findings_index.py
    python tools/findings_index.py --check

All of them use the standard library only (Python 3.8+). Contributions of new tools are welcome. Follow the rules above and RULES.md.
